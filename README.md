# 🌧️ Rain Prediction EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for predicting rainfall based on historical weather data. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in building a predictive model for rain occurrence.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖 (for preprocessing)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains various weather attributes such as:
- Temperature 🌡️
- Humidity 💦
- Wind Speed 💨
- Atmospheric Pressure 🌍
- Rainfall ☔ (target variable)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values ✅
- Removing duplicates 🗑️
- Encoding categorical variables 🔢

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Creating new features 🌟
- Scaling numerical values 📏

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
- Correlation heatmaps 🔥
- Rainfall distribution plots 🌦️
- Box plots for outlier detection 📦

## 📊 Key Insights
✅ Higher humidity increases the likelihood of rain.
✅ Wind speed has a moderate impact on rainfall.
✅ Sudden drops in temperature are associated with rain occurrences.

## 🚀 How to Use
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kumawatmanish05/rain-prediction-eda.git
cd rain-prediction-eda

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
